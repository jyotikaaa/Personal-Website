This android application works as a depression detector.<br>It uses a machine learning approach to detect depression with python scripts as backend.<br>The user is made to take a mcq test based on the answers of which the machine learning algorithm can
label the depression stage.<br>The three labels include: no depression, mild depression and severe depression.<br>My contribution in the project has been designing the front end with Android Studio IDE using java.
<br>We are still working on this project as a part of our Design Engineering subject.
